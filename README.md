# SGTabbedPagerTest
Xamarin SGTabbedPager Test inside a UITabBarViewController and a ContainerView.

It was made to show the creator of SGTabbedPager @Cheesebaron, the issue Im having when including the component inside a Container view which is part of one of the Viewcontrollers tabs of a UITabBarController.

If you move the tab of the SGTabbedPager and then go to another tab in the TabBarController and get back, the SGTabbedPager views won't appear.
